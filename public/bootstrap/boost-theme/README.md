# Thank you for purchasing Boost Theme #

## Docs

The `docs/index.html` page contains a brief guide to getting started.  To view, just open in your favorite browser:

```
$ open dist/docs/index.html
```

## Gulpfile.js

The theme includes an optional Gulp file to help you to customize it. You’ll need to install Node.js and Gulp CLI before using our included gulpfile.js.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install Gulp CLI, run the following command:

```
npm i gulp-cli -g
```

When you’re done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - recompiles and minifies your theme assets into your `dist` directory.
